## Chapter One - Your first Task!
Monday morning - you just set up your office space and enjoy the random slack channel when suddenly you project manager assigns you your first task! it reads:

    Alice would like to be able to see the not-checked items in the Todolist at the top and have the checked ones at the bottom of the list, so she can see her tasks that need to be done first.

    please implement this feature as your first task!

## Chapter Two - UX matters!

After finishing your first task you feel pretty good about yourself! You had a delightful lunch break at noon but now it's time to grab the next issue from the sprint backlog.

    Users complain that the timestamp displayed after the Text of the ToDo items are always saying `5 minutes ago` even if they created that Todo an hour ago - plx fix asap!

Upon a quick glance at the codebase you notice that Frank did not implement this feature at all but just put a static text in there before leaving for an 8 week vacation to an unspecified remote location - your other colleagues just shrug: 'classic Frank!'

Please come the the rescue and implement this 'TimeAgo-Feature' correctly.

## Chapter Three - cleaning up the mess!

    Some figurehead wanted us to add a Remove button next to the Todo Items to delete them forever - he sounded really important.

    Looks like we finally get to implement this to do in the store - don't forget to add a corresponding unittest! 

    -Frank
